# hr-resource-query-chatbot
HR Resource Query Chatbot
Objective
Build an intelligent HR assistant chatbot that can answer resource allocation queries using natural language processing and retrieval techniques.

Problem Statement
Create an AI-powered chatbot that helps HR teams find employees by answering queries like:

"Find Python developers with 3+ years experience"
"Who has worked on healthcare projects?"
"Suggest people for a React Native project"
"Find developers who know both AWS and Docker"
Core Requirements
Data Layer
Create sample employee dataset (15+ employees)
Include: name, skills, experience_years, past_projects, availability
AI/ML Component (RAG System)
Retrieval: Parse queries and find relevant employees using embeddings
Augmentation: Combine retrieved employee data with query context
Generation: Use LLM to create natural language responses with recommendations
Implementation Options:

Full RAG: OpenAI/Llama + embeddings + vector search
Hybrid: Semantic search + template-based responses
Advanced: HuggingFace transformers + FAISS + local LLM (Ollama)
Simple: Embedding similarity + smart formatting (no LLM required)
Backend API (Python/FastAPI)
REST endpoint for chat queries: POST /chat
Employee search endpoint: GET /employees/search
Basic error handling and validation
Preferred: FastAPI for automatic docs and async support
Frontend Interface
Simple chat interface
Display employee results clearly
Can use Streamlit, React, or simple HTML
üìä Sample Data Structure
{
  "employees": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "skills": ["Python", "React", "AWS"],
      "experience_years": 5,
      "projects": ["E-commerce Platform", "Healthcare Dashboard"],
      "availability": "available"
    }
  ]
}
üîç Expected Interaction (RAG System)
User: "I need someone experienced with machine learning for a healthcare project"

RAG Process:

Retrieval: Find employees with ML + healthcare experience
Augmentation: Combine their profiles with query context
Generation: Create natural response
Response: "Based on your requirements for ML expertise in healthcare, I found 2 excellent candidates:

Dr. Sarah Chen would be perfect for this role. She has 6 years of ML experience and specifically worked on the 'Medical Diagnosis Platform' project where she implemented computer vision for X-ray analysis. Her skills include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and medical data processing. She's currently available and has published 3 papers on healthcare AI.

Michael Rodriguez is another strong candidate with 4 years of ML experience. He built the 'Patient Risk Prediction System' using ensemble methods and has experience with HIPAA compliance for healthcare data. He knows scikit-learn, pandas, and has worked with electronic health records.

Both have the technical depth and domain expertise you need. Would you like me to provide more details about their specific healthcare projects or check their availability for meetings?"

## API Documentation
Endpoint descriptions and examples
## AI Development Process
**Document how you used AI tools in your development:**
- Which AI coding assistants did you use? (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
- How did AI help in different phases? (code generation, debugging, architecture decisions)
- What percentage of code was AI-assisted vs hand-written?
- Any interesting AI-generated solutions or optimizations?
- Challenges where AI couldn't help and you solved manually?
## Technical Decisions
Explain your choice of technologies and trade-offs:
- Why did you choose OpenAI vs open-source models?
- Local LLM (Ollama) vs cloud API considerations?
- Performance vs cost vs privacy trade-offs?
## Future Improvements
What would you add with more time?

üí° Development Tips
AI-Assisted Development Feel free to use modern AI development tools:

Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot for code generation
ChatGPT, Claude for architecture planning
AI debuggers for troubleshooting
Document your AI usage process in README
Quick Start Options

FastAPI + Streamlit: Recommended Python stack
FastAPI + HuggingFace + React: Full-stack option
FastAPI + Ollama: Complete offline solution (Llama, Mistral, Qwen)
Flask alternative: If more familiar, but FastAPI preferred
Success Strategy

Start with basic keyword search, then enhance with AI
Use JSON files for quick data setup
Focus on working functionality over perfect code
Test with realistic HR queries
Document your AI development journey
üöÄ Submission
GitHub Repository: Public repo with all code
Demo Link: Working application (Streamlit Cloud, Vercel, etc.) or clear local setup
Timeline: 2 days
Note: This is a practical assessment of your ability to rapidly build AI-powered applications using modern development tools and practices. We're interested in both your technical skills and how you leverage AI assistance in development.
